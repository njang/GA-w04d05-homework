#### Hint: npm install moment and chalk (read documentation about what they do first) 
#### Don't forget to npm init

#### Use console.log() to have things show up on your terminal. 
#### We will go over this homework together on Monday morning. 

## 3. Bonus - Github FUN!!!
#### Pick someone else's repository on GitHub. Clone or Fork it, create a branch, add a feature to that project, and push it up. 
#### Make pull requests and make your first succesful contribution to someone else's project. 

#### Here are a few resources that will help you work with GitHub work flow.
